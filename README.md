# Data-scraping-and-analysis
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a public website, clean and preprocess it, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to collect information about books (titles, prices, and ratings) from Books to Scrape, a dummy website designed for practicing web scraping, and analyze the dataset to uncover insights.
